# Introduction
**Astrology**, which is a method of divination by observing the stars, can be a very important part of worldbuilding. The basis of astrology is *Spherical Astronomy*, the science of observing the sky. This post will serve as a guide to spherical astronomy for the worldbuilder.

# I. Coordinates
In spherical astronomy, the preferred method of locating a point in space is with [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system) (Wikipedia). This is a coordinate system based on three values:
```math
\begin{align}
\varphi &= \text{the vertical angle,}
\\ \theta &= \text{the horizontal angle,}
\\ \rho &= \text{the radius.}
\end{align}
```
$\rho$ is the distance from the origin to the point in question, $\theta$ is the angle East from North, and $\varphi$ is the angle of altitude from the $xy$-plane. (Note in mathematics and physics (and the diagram on Wikipedia), instead of $\varphi$ being the angle above the $xy$-plane, it is the complement of that angle, the angle down from the $z$-axis.) Thus, $\theta$ ranges from $0\degree$ to $360\degree$, and $\varphi$ from $-90\degree$ to $90\degree$.

This coordinate system can be thought of as the longitude-latitude system of Earth, where $\theta$ is the longitude, and $\varphi$ is the latitude.
Using trigonometry, one can find the radius of the latitude circle of a sphere with radius $\rho$ is $\rho \cos(\varphi)$ (View figure), so:

```math
\begin{align}
x &= \rho \cos(\varphi) \cos(\theta)
\\ y &= \rho \cos(\varphi) \sin(\theta)
\\ z &= \rho \sin(\varphi)
\end{align}
```
Where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the cartesian coordinates of the point described by $\rho$, $\theta$, and $\varphi$.\
The reverse transformation, also derived by simple geometry, is given below:
```math
\begin{align}
\rho &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\\ \theta &= \arctan(y, x)
\\ \varphi &= \arcsin(z / \rho)
\end{align}
```
Where $\arctan(y, x)$ is the [two argument arctangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2), used to avoid tangent ambiguity.

There are three coordinate systems of special importance. The [Equatorial Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system), the [Ecliptic Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_coordinate_system). and the [Horizontal Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system),
