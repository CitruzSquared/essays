## 1. Newton's Law of Gravitation
Newton's law of gravitation is the law that determines the force of gravity between two objects.  

It is given by F = GMm/R², where M is the mass of the first object (in kg), m is the mass of the second object (in kg), R is the distance in between them (in m), G is a constant equalling 6.67e-11 m³/kgs², and F is the force in between those two objects (in Newtons).  

Everything discussed in this text stems from this equation.

## 2. Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
In orbital mechanics, there are 3 laws called Kepler's laws. (Because Johannes Kepler found them out).  
They can all be derived from Newton's law of gravitation, but I will not write down the derivations here.  
The laws are as follows:
### I. All orbits are elliptical, with the primary object at one of the ellipse's foci.

Pictured here is an ellipse. It is like a squished circle. There are two things you should know about the ellipse:  
- The semi-major axis is the long "radius" of the ellipse. The distance from the center to the vertex.  
- The foci are the points at which the distance from the co-vertex to the foci equal the length of the semi-major axis.
The focus has many properties, but I will not get into them here. 

Kepler's first law states that the primary body of the orbit (The body the orbit is centered around) is at one of the foci.  

Well that's a bit of a lie. Technically its the barycenter, the center of mass of the two bodies, that is at the focus. But in cases where the two masses are incomparibly different, say the Sun and the Earth, this fact can be ignored and we can place the primary object at one of the foci.

### II. The line connecting the two bodies "sweeps" out equal areas during equal durations of time.

Kepler's second law states that when a body orbits another one, the line connecting them will "sweep" out equal areas during equal durations of time.

In the gif, the blue area is the area the planet is currently sweeping out in some fixed time interval, and Kepler's 2nd law states that the area of the blue region stays constant.

This defines the speed at which the body travels around the elliptical orbit.

### 3. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital semi-major axis.
