# Sidereal and Synodic. What's the difference? 
Here I will explain the difference between sidereal cycles and synodic cycles in astronomy. 
If you want the conclusion first, here it is:  
- Sidereal: Absolute
- Synodic: Relative to a viewer

## 1. Introduction
What do I mean by the terms "Absolute" and "Relative"?  
Well, "Absolute" here means the locations of celestial objects relative to the distant fixed stars[^1].  "Relative" on the other hand, refers to the location of said celestial objects from our point of view, on Earth (or any other celestial body.)

To better explain:  

The image to the left represents a model of the Solar System. The orange planet represents Venus, and the blue planet Earth.  

If we take the vertical downward direction as our reference for zero degrees, then we can see that Venus has orbited through the orange angle.  
Or, in other terms, the orange angle represents Venus's angular distance from the absolute reference axis.
This angle is called the **true anomaly** of Venus.  
The true anomaly of Earth is shown in blue around the Sun.

The green angle, which is the angular distance of venus from the Sun, *from the viewpoint of Earth*.  
This is called the **elongation**[^2] of Venus (from Earth).  
It is evident that Earth cannot, and does not, have an elongation from Earth.

As one could imagine, "Sidereal" deals with the true anomaly, based on the absolute reference axis, and "Synodic" deals with the elongation, based on the viewpoint of Earth.
  


## 2. Orbital Period of Planets
### 2.1 Sidereal Orbital Period

In this gif, I have animated a **Sidereal** orbit cycle of Venus.   

It is a full cycle from 0˚ to 360˚ of Venus's *true anomaly* (the orange angle), with respect to the reference axis.   
As is evident, this is what we usually mean when we hear "Orbital Period".   

Venus's sidereal orbital period is roughly 224.7 Earth days, while Earth's is roughly 365.25 Earth days.

### 2.2 Synodic Orbital Period

It will be useful to define more terms:
- "Conjunction" refers to when the *elongation* of a planet from the Sun[^2] equals zero. This means that from Earth's point of view, the planet and the Sun are at the same point in the sky. For inferior planets, this may occur in two cases: Interior conjunction, and Superior conjunction. For superior planets, there is only 1 kind of conjunction.  

- "Opposition" refers to when the *elongation* of a planet equals 180˚. This means the Sun[^2] and the planet are at exactly opposite sides in the Sky. Inferior planets cannot oppose the Sun. 
 
- "Maximum elongation" refers to the maximum angle an inferior planet can appear in the sky away from the Sun.  

- "Quadrature" refers to when the elongation of a superior planet is 90˚.

In this gif, I have animated the elongation of Venus from Earth.

A **Synodic** orbital cycle is the cycle of elongation. Venus goes from interior conjunction to interior conjunction over this period.

The starting and end points may be taken from any point (conjunction, opposition, etc), but as it is a cycle, it will always give the same period.

The synodic orbital period of Venus from Earth is about 584 days.

Here I have animated the orbits of the Earth (in light blue) and Neptune (in dark blue) over one synodic period.

Neptune, being so far from the sun, has a sidereal orbital period of 60,195 days.

However, because it is so slow, it almost doesn't move, and therefore from Earth, Neptune is in opposition almost every time the Earth completes an orbit. This results in Neptune's synodic orbital period being just a bit longer than a year, at 369.5 days.

## 2. Orbital Period of the Moon (Months)
### 2.1 Sidereal Months

The same idea can be applied to the Moon.

Here I have animated the orbit of the Moon around the Earth, with the reference axis being projected from the Earth.

The **Sidereal** month is the time needed for the Moon to complete an orbit with respect to the reference axis. This is commonly referred to as just the orbital period of the Moon.  
For our Moon, this is equal to 27.3 days.

### 2.2 Synodic Months

However, unfortunately, because the Moon is illuminated by the Sun, its phases also depend on the Sun, and therefore not the true anomaly but the elongation.  
Therefore, to construct a lunar calendar, we must look at the synodic month.  

Here I have animated the synodic cycle of the Moon, which will be discussed in further detail below:

Here is a diagram of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.  
The reference axis for the sidereal orbit is the white vertical line.  
The axis that aligns with the Sun is drawn in green.  

1 is the beginning position of the Earth.  
As the moon orbits the Earth, the Earth also orbits the Sun, such that when 1 sidereal orbit of the Moon is complete, the Earth is at position 2.  

However, this is not enough for the Moon to be in conjunction with the Sun again, and therefore must rotate through the additional purple angle.  
This results in the synodic month being longer than the sidereal month, at a length of 29.5 days.

This is the length of the month used in all major lunar calendars on Earth.

## 3. Rotational Periods (Days)

The difference between the sidereal day and the synodic day can be visualized quite easily with this diagram from Wikipedia.

A sidereal day is the time needed for the Earth (or any planet) to rotate 360 degrees around its axis, relative to a reference axis.  
On Earth this takes 23 hours and 56 minutes.

However, because the Earth also orbited around the Sun during this period, for the Earth to face the sun again, it must rotate through an additional small angle.

This results in a synodic, or solar day to be about 4 minutes longer than the sidereal rotational period, resulting in the familiar 24 hour long days.

## 4. Conclusion
The formulas for calculating the synodic periods from the sidereal periods, or vice versa, can be found from Wikipedia.  
I hope this document helped you understand the difference between sidereal and synodic.

[^2]: Elongation may be taken from any other celestial object, but in our case I will always be referring to elongation from the Sun.
