### Lunar Libration
It is commonly known that only one side of the Moon ever faces the Earth, i.e. the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth. However, this does not mean we can only see exactly $50$% of the Moon. Because of the Moon's orbit is not a perfect circle, we can see a bit more than $50$% of the Moon depending on the position of the Moon, and this effect is known as *libration*.
