# Part 2. Terrestrial Observations
In the last part, we discussed how to calculate the positions of the planets in space. Let's now discuss how they look from the Earth.

## IV. Appearance

### Apparent Radius

Well, in this diagram, an observer at point $O$ is looking at an object with center $C$ and radius $r$. The [*angular size*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter) (denoted $\delta$, also called the *angular diameter*) is then given by the angle $AOA'$, which is $2 \cdot AOC$. The angle $AOC$, which is called the *angular radius* (denoted $\theta$), is given by this formula:
```math
AOC = \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{r}{OC}\right) \tag{53}
```
Because $AO$ makes a right angle with $AC$, the radius. Thus,
```math
\delta = 2\arcsin\left(\frac{r}{D}\right)\tag{54}
```
where $D$ is the distance to the object, $OC$.

#### Example 11
<div align="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<td align="center">
<img width="2000" height="0"><br>
Given that Mercury's perihelion distance is $46\:000\:000\text{ km}$, and the Sun's radius is $696\:000\text{ km}$, <br/>
How big does the Sun look from Mercury when it is at perihelion?

</table>
</div>

By equation $54$:
```math
\begin{align}
\delta &= 2\arcsin\left(\frac{696\:000}{46\:000\:000}\right)\\
&= 1\degree\enspace44'\enspace2''
\end{align}
```
Which is almost as three times large as the Sun looks from Earth.\

### Phase

Let's now calculate how much of an object would be visible.

The line $LL'$ perpendicular to $SP$ and delineates the *terminator line* of $P$, or the line where night and day are separated. The line $HH'$ is perpendicular to $EP$ and shows the side of the planet visible to $E$.
