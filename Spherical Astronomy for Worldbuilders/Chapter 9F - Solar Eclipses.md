### Limits of Partiality
There are generally two limits at which partial eclipses can be observed, one in the North and one in the South. In the case that there are no internal contacts, only one of the two will exist. As discussed in the *Curve of Maximum Eclipse on the Horizon* section, The limit of visibility of an eclipse is given by two conditions:
```math
\begin{align}
P' &= 0 \\
\Delta &= l
\end{align}
```
Which means that the moment of maximum eclipse occurs when the point of observation is just on the edge of the shadow â€“ meaning the shadow of the Moon only barely grazes past this point. To solve the first of these conditions, recall the expression for $P'$ (equation $9.50$):
```math
P' = a' + (c' - (i^2 + 1)\zeta \mu'\cos(d))\sin(Q) + (-b' + (i^2 + 1)\zeta d')\cos(Q)
```
In this equation, if we set:
```math
\begin{align}
C &= c' - (i^2 + 1)\zeta \mu' \cos(d) \\
B &= b' - (i^2 + 1)\zeta d'
\end{align} \tag{9.72}
```
