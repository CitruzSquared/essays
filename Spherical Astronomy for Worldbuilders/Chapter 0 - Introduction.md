# Introduction
**Astrology**, which is a method of divination based on the location of the stars and planets in the sky, can be a very important part of worldbuilding. The basis of astrology is *Spherical Astronomy*, the science of observing the sky. This post will serve as a guide to spherical astronomy for the worldbuilder, and will start from the basics and build up to calculating the location of objects in the sky, and also calculate the time and visibility of several astronomical phenomena such that the worldbuilder can use these calculations in their astrological systems.

**NOTE!** Some of the derivations of formulae in this guide assumes the reader is familiar with algebra, trigonometry, basic differentiation and integration, basic vector operations, and basic matrix operations. (See ยง Useful Mathematics)
