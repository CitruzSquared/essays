## 10. Lunar Eclipses
Lunar eclipses happen when the Earth casts a shadow on the Moon. As it is a phenomenon that really changes the appearance of the Moon, anywhere on the Earth that can see the Moon during a lunar eclipse will see it, unlike solar eclipses. This makes the discussion of lunar eclipses much simpler than the discussion of solar eclipses.

### Conditions for Eclipse
A lunar eclipse can only happen when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, i.e. they only happen during full moons. We can say that the shadow of the Earth is a circlular disk projected at the distance of the Moon.

We further have that:
```math
\begin{align}
LEM &= BLE - LVE\\
&= BLE - (AES - EAV) \\
&= \pi - s' + \pi'
\end{align}
```
Where $\pi$ is the equatorial horizontal parallax of the Moon, $s'$ is the apparent radius of the Sun, and $\pi'$ is the equatorial horizontal parallax of the Sun.

Since the Moon and the Earth's shadow are at the same distance from the Earth, their parallaxes are equal (and thus no relative parallax) and therefore the least separation of the Moon and shadow $\Sigma$ must be:
```math
\Sigma < (\pi - s' + \pi') + s
```
Which, using equation $9.1$, becomes:
```math
\beta < (\pi - s' + \pi' + s)\sec(I') \tag{10.1}
```
Where $\beta$ is the ecliptic latitude of the Moon at the moment of opposition.

The above is the case for total lunar eclipse. For penumbral lunar eclipses, the radius of the Earth's shadow can be expressed as $\pi + s' + \pi'$ and thus the condition for eclipse is:
```math
\beta < (\pi + s' + \pi' + s)\sec(I') \tag{10.2}
```
