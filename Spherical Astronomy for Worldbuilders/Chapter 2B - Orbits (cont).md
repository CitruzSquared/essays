### Kepler's Second Law
We have discussed Kepler's first and third laws. Now let us tackle his second law, which states that the area sweeped out by a planet over a unit time must stay constant.

The area of a sector with radius $r$ and central angle $\theta$ is given by:
```math
S = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \theta
```
And therefore the area sweeped out by a planet over a small increment $d\nu$ of true anomaly is:
```math
dS = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\nu
```
And therefore the area sweeped out per unit time is
```math
\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{r^2}{2}\frac{d\nu}{dt}
```
And this must stay constant.\
Because the area of an ellipse is $\pi a b$,
```math
T \frac{dS}{dt} = T\frac{r^2}{2}\frac{d\nu}{dt} = \pi a b
```
where $T$ is the orbital period.\
Therefore:
```math
r^2 \frac{d\nu}{dt} = \frac{2\pi a b}{T} 
```
now, denoting $2\pi/T$ as $n$ (this quantity is called the [mean motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_motion)), we obtain:
```math
r^2 \nu' = nab = na^2\sqrt{1 - e^2}\tag{22}
```

Now, recall equation $20$:
```math
r = a(1 - e\cos (E))
```
Differentiating both sides with respect to time gives us:
```math
r' = ae\sin(E)E' \tag{23}
```
Now recall equation $18$:
```math
\begin{align}
r &= \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e\cos(\nu)} \\
\therefore\frac{1}{r} &= \frac{1 + e\cos(\nu)}{a(1 - e^2)}
\end{align}
```
Differentiating both sides of this equation we obtain:
```math
\begin{align}
-\frac{r'}{r^2} = -\frac{e \sin (\nu) \nu'}{a(1 - e^2)} \\
\therefore r' = \frac{e\sin(\nu)r^2\nu'}{a(1 - e^2)} \tag{24}
\end{align}
```
Now we substitute equation $22$ in equation $24$:
```math
r' = \frac{nae\sin(\nu)}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}}
```
Equating this with equation $23$:
```math
\begin{align}
ae\sin(E)E' &= \frac{nae\sin(\nu)}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}}\\
E' &= \frac{n\sin(\nu)}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}\sin(E)}
\end{align}
```
But $\sqrt{1 - e^2}\sin(E)$ is just $y_{\text{perifocal}}/a$ by equation $19$, and $y_{\text{perifocal}} = r\sin(\nu)$ by equation $17$, so:
```math
\begin{align}
E' &= \frac{n\sin(\nu)}{r\sin(\nu)/a}\\
\therefore rE' &= na
\end{align}
```
Now, substituting equation $20$ for $r$:
```math
(1 - e\cos (E)) E' = n
```
Integrating over time on both sides yields:
```math
E - e\sin(E) = nt + c.
```
If we measure $t$ from the time of periapsis, then when $t = 0$, $E - e\sin(E) = 0$ since $E = 0$ at periapsis. Therefore $c. = 0$.\
Let's also denote $nt$ as $M$. We call this quantity the [*mean anomaly*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_anomaly):
```math
M = nt = \frac{2\pi}{T}\cdot t\tag{25}
```
Now the equation becomes:
```math
M = E - e\sin (E) \tag{26}
```
Which is known as [**Kepler's Equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation). This equation allows us to relate $E$ and $M$, thus relating $E$ and $t$, which allows us to finally calculate the motion of the planets.

#### Example 4
<div align="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<td align="center">
<img width="2000" height="0"><br>
The orbital period of the Earth $T = 365.2422\text{ dy}$, and the eccentricity of its orbit is $0.0167$. <br/>

</table>
</div>

Because ecliptic coordinates are based on the Earth's orbital plane, it effectively is equal to the Earth's perifocal coordinate frame, except that the $x$-axis is rotated from the direction of perihelion to the direction of Aries. Therefore, we can use our perifocal equations in the ecliptic frame without much trouble.

Spring Equinox in the Northern Hemisphere is defined as $\lambda_{\text{Sun, Geocentric}} = 0\degree$, therefore (by equation $5$) it occurs when $\lambda_{\text{Earth, Heliocentric}} = 180\degree$. Thus, the true anomaly of the Earth at the time of Northern Spring Equinox is:
```math
\begin{align}
\nu &= 180\degree - 102\degree\enspace56'\enspace49.9''\\
&= 77\degree\enspace3'\enspace50.1''
\end{align}
```
Now, by equation $21$:
```math
\begin{align}
\cos (E) &= \frac{e + \cos(\nu)}{1 + e\cos(\nu)}\\
&= \frac{0.0167 + \cos(77\degree\enspace3'\enspace50.1'')}{1 + 0.0167\cos(77\degree\enspace3'\enspace50.1'')}\\
&= 0.239855411\\
\therefore E &= 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.18''
\end{align}
```
Now, by Kepler's equation (equation $26$):
```math
\begin{align}
M &= E - e\sin (E)\\
&= 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.18'' - 0.0167 \sin (76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.18'')\\
&= 76\degree\enspace6'\enspace20.81''
\end{align}
```
Therefore, by the definition of $M$ (equation $25$):
```math
\begin{align}
M &= \frac{360\degree}{T}\cdot t\\
\therefore t &= \frac{TM}{360\degree}\\
&=\frac{365.2422\text{ dy} \cdot 6\degree\enspace6'\enspace20.81''}{360\degree}\\
&= 77\text{ dy}\enspace5h\enspace8m.
\end{align}
```
$77\text{ dy}\enspace5h\enspace8m$ after $\text{January 3, }2024\enspace00:38$ is $\text{March 20, }2024\enspace05:46$.\
Comparing to the true time ($\text{March 20, }2024\enspace03:07$), we can see that we are very close. The discrepancy comes from rounding error and the fact that the motion of the Earth is not a true two body problem.\
$\blacksquare$

However what we really want is the reverse operation of example $4$: going from a specific time to a location. Sounds easy: $M$ is very easy to calculate, and $E$ gives us the exact coordinates $(x, y)$, and we have a relation between $M$ and $E$ by [Kepler's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation) (equation $26$)!\
Unfortunately, Kepler's equation
```math
M = E - e\sin (E)
```
is [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_function), which means $E$ cannot be solved for $M$ analytically.\
However, there is hope! We can solve for $E$ [*numerically*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis). 

First we rearrange the equation:
```math
E - e \sin (E) - M = 0
```
We then define $f$ as a function of $E$ to be $f(E) = E - e \sin (E) - M$. Then we juse need to find the root of $f(E) = 0$.\
We use the [Newtonâ€“Raphson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), given by the iterative equation
```math
x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. \tag{27}
```
Clearly, we need to find $f'(E)$.
```math
\frac{df}{dE} =  1 - e \cos (E)
```
By plugging all the values into equation $27$, we obtain:
```math
E_{n + 1} = E_n - \frac{E_n - e\sin(E_n) - M}{1 - e\cos(E_n)} \tag{28}
```
which we can use to iteratively obtain better and better approximations of $E$, which we can then use to find the coordinates of the planet.
#### Example 5
<div align="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<td align="center">
<img width="2000" height="0"><br>
The Earth has orbital period $T = 365.2422\text{ dy}$, its orbit has semi-major axis $a = 149.6 \text{ Gm}$, and its eccentricity $e = 0.0167$. <br/>

<img width="2000" height="0">

</table>
</div>

Due to the definition of the ecliptic coordinate frame, we can use our perifocal equations in it without much trouble. (See example $4$.)\
We first calculate M by equation $25$:
```math
\begin{align}
M &= \frac{360\degree}{365.2422\text{ dy}} \cdot77 \text{ dy}\enspace5h\enspace8m \\
&= 76\degree\enspace6'\enspace20.811''
\end{align}
```
We now perform the Newton iteration. We first guess $E_1 = M$, and obtain $E_2$ by equation $28$.
```math
\begin{align}
E_2 &= M - \frac{M - e\sin(M) - M}{1 - e\cos(M)}\\
&= 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.397''
\end{align}
```
We perform it again, now using $E_2$ for $E_n$.
```math
\begin{align}
E_3 &= E_2 - \frac{E_2 - e\sin(E_2) - M}{1 - e\cos(E_2)}\\
&= 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.175''
\end{align}
```
Here is the table of repetitions:
```math
\begin{array}{cccc}\hline n & & & E_n \\ \hline
1 & & & 76\degree\enspace6'\enspace20.811'' \\
2 & & & 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.397'' \\
3 & & & 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.175'' \\
4 & & & 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.176'' \\
5 & & & 76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.176'' \\ \hline
\end{array}
```
As we can see, $E$ has quickly converged onto $76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.176''$. In general it can be assumed that $E_5$ will be enough.\
We can now calculate $(x, y)$ with equation $19$:
```math
\begin{align}
x_{\text{perifocal}} &= a \cos (E) - ae\\
&= 149.6 \cos(76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.18'') - 149.6 \cdot 0.0167 \\
&= 33.384 \text{ Gm}\\
\\
y_{\text{perifocal}} &= b \sin (E)\\
&= a\sqrt{1 - e^2} \sin (E)\\
&= 149.6 \sqrt{(1 - 0.0167^2)} \sin(76\degree\enspace7'\enspace19.18'')\\
&= 145.213 \text{ Gm}
\end{align}
```
Then, by equation $17$, the true anomaly is:
```math
\arctan(145.213, 33.384) = 77\degree\enspace3'\enspace10.27''
```
Which, when added with the ecliptic longitude of the periapsis $102\degree\enspace56'\enspace49.9''$ gives:
```math
\lambda_{\text{Earth, Heliocentric}} = 180\degree\enspace(+ 0.17'')
```
Which agrees with example $4$. (The $0.17''$ is due to stray rounding error.)\
$\blacksquare$

The angle between $\textbf{r}$ and $d\textbf{r}$ has been called $s$.

The area of this triangle $dA$ well represents the small area that is sweeped out by the planet over a small time $dt$. This area is given by:
```math
dA = \frac{1}{2}rdr\sin(s)
```
where $r$ and $dr$ are the magnitudes of $\textbf{r}$ and $d\textbf{r}$ respectively. This can be written in vector form as:
```math
d\textbf{A} = \frac{1}{2}\textbf{r}\times d\textbf{r}
```
dividing by $dt$ to get the area swept out per unit time,
```math
\frac{d\textbf{A}}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}\textbf{r}\times \frac{d\textbf{r}}{dt}
```
Kepler's second law states that this quantity $d\textbf{A}/dt$ must be constant, which means that $d^2\textbf{A}/dt^2 = \textbf{0}$.\
Calculating $d^2\textbf{A}/dt^2 = 0$:
```math
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2\textbf{A}}{dt^2} &= \frac{1}{2}(\frac{d\textbf{r}}{dt}\times\frac{d\textbf{r}}{dt} + \textbf{r}\times \frac{d^2\textbf{r}}{dt^2})\\
&= \frac{1}{2}(\textbf{v}\times\textbf{v} + \textbf{r}\times\textbf{a})\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\textbf{r}\times\textbf{a}
\end{align}
```
where $\textbf{v}$ and $\textbf{a}$ are the velocity and acceleration of $P$ respectively.\
However, it has been shown previously (in the proof of Kepler's first law) that $\textbf{r}$ is parallel to $\textbf{a}$ and therefore
```math
\frac{d^2\textbf{A}}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{2}\textbf{r}\times\textbf{a} = \textbf{0}.
```
Which proves Kepler's second law.\
$\blacksquare$

### Orientation of Orbits in 3D Space
In examples $4$ and $5$, we have calculated the position of the Earth in ecliptic coordinates, which was simple because the Earth's perifocal plane was the definition of the Ecliptic plane. Other planets are not so simple. Let:
```math
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
&(p, q, s) \text{ denote the perifocal cartesian coordinates of an object, and}\\
&(x, y, z) \text{ denote the heliocentric ecliptic cartesian coordinates of the object}
\end{align}
}
```

#### Orbital Elements

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/CitruzSquared/essays/assets/23460281/22bef238-757a-4561-8d17-3b41dbf22c5b" width="350"/> This diagram depicts the orbit of a non-Earth planet $Q$ where $O$ is the location of the Sun and $P$ is the periapsis of the orbit. The direction of orbit is given by the arrow pointing from $P$ to $Q$. Thus the true anomaly $\nu$ of $Q$ is the angle $POQ$.

As one can see, the orbit is tilted upwards from the Ecliptic plane by an angle $i$, and therefore forms a line of intersection. The angle $i$ is called the [*inclination*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination), and the line where the orbit crosses the ecliptic plane (the line $ND$) is known as the [*line of nodes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node). The point on the line of nodes where the planet is moving upwards (point $N$) is called the *ascending node* and the other point is known as the *descending node* (point $D$)

The angle $AON$ is known as the [*longitude of the ascending node*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_ascending_node) and is denoted $\Omega$, and the angle $NOP$ is known as the [*argument of periapsis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_periapsis) and is denoted $\omega$. Then, remembering that the $x$-axis in the ecliptic frame points towards Aries, and that the $p$-axis in the perifocal frame points towards the periapsis, the ecliptic frame can be transformed into the perifocal frame by the procedure below:
```math
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\text{1. } & \text{Rotate the ecliptic in the direction of the orbit plane by } \Omega.\\
\text{2. } & \text{Then, rotate it upwards by } i.\\
\text{3. } & \text{Then, rotate it in the direction of the orbit by } \omega.\\
\end{align}
}
```
This results in the $x$-axis now pointing in the $p$ direction.

This can be done with rotation matrices:
- Step 1 - we rotate by $\Omega$ about the $z$-axis.
```math
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos{(\Omega)} & \sin{(\Omega)}  & 0\\
-\sin{(\Omega)} & \cos{(\Omega)} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```
- Step 2 - we rotate by $i$ about the $x$-axis (which now points in the direction of $N$).
```math
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \cos{(i)} & \sin{(i)}\\
0 & -\sin{(i)} & \cos{(i)}
\end{bmatrix}
```
- Step 3 - we rotate by $\omega$ about the $z$-axis (which now points perpendicular to the orbital plane).
```math
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos{(\omega)} & \sin{(\omega)}  & 0\\
-\sin{(\omega)} & \cos{(\omega)} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```
Now, the full rotation matrix is given by multiplying all these steps together:
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
p \\ q \\ s
\end{bmatrix}
=
CBA
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}
```
Actually carrying out the matrix multiplication, this is:
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
p \\ q \\ s
\end{bmatrix}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\Omega\cos\omega - \sin\Omega\cos i\sin\omega & \sin\Omega\cos\omega + \cos\Omega\cos i\sin\omega  &  \sin i \sin\omega \\
  -\cos\Omega\sin\omega - \sin\Omega\cos i\cos \omega & -\sin\Omega\sin\omega + \cos\Omega\cos i\cos\omega &\sin i \cos\omega \\
   \sin\Omega \sin i  &  -\cos \Omega \sin i  & \cos i
 \end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{29}
```
The reverse transformation, going from the perifocal frame to the ecliptic frame, is given by the transpose of $CBA$:
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\Omega\cos\omega - \sin\Omega\cos i\sin\omega & -\cos\Omega\sin\omega - \sin\Omega\cos i\cos \omega & \sin\Omega \sin i \\
  \sin\Omega\cos\omega + \cos\Omega\cos i\sin\omega & -\sin\Omega\sin\omega + \cos\Omega\cos i\cos\omega & -\cos \Omega \sin i \\
  \sin i \sin\omega & \sin i \cos\omega &  \cos i
 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p \\ q \\ s
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{30}
```
Thus the exact position of $Q$ can be calculated in ecliptic coordinates from the values $a, e, i, \Omega, \omega,$ and $\nu$, and these are called the [**orbital elements**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements) of $Q$.

However, if we recognize the fact that $s$ is almost always going to be $0$ in our case (because planets move in the plane of their orbit, there will be almost no cases where we *do* have a $s$ component), we can safely say that, when going from perifocal coordinates to ecliptic coordinates:
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\Omega\cos\omega - \sin\Omega\cos i\sin\omega & -\cos\Omega\sin\omega - \sin\Omega\cos i\cos \omega & 0 \\
  \sin\Omega\cos\omega + \cos\Omega\cos i\sin\omega & -\sin\Omega\sin\omega + \cos\Omega\cos i\cos\omega & 0 \\
  \sin i \sin\omega & \sin i \cos\omega & 0
 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p \\ q \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{31}
```

Note that, for Earth, since $i = 0\degree$, $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are on the same plane, and therefore only their sum matters, and as long as $\Omega$ and $\omega$ sum to the same number, their actual values do not matter and the results of equations $29$ and $30$ will not change.
