## Introduction
**Astrology**, which is a method of divination based on the location of the stars and planets in the sky, can be a very important part of worldbuilding. The basis of astrology is *Spherical Astronomy*, the science of observing the sky. This post will serve as a guide to spherical astronomy for the worldbuilder, and will start from the basics and build up to calculating the location of stars in the sky and finally a complete ephemeris, from which the worldbuilder can create their own astrological system.
