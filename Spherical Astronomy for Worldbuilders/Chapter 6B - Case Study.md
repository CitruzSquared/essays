### Saturn in the Sky
Let's try to figure out how Saturn looked in the sky on $\text{January 1, } 2024$ at $19:00$ from London, UK ($\phi = +50\degree, l = 0\degree$).

#### Data Collection
To figure out what Saturn looked like from the Earth, we must first know how Saturn looks in general:

In addition to that though, the planet has some gorgeous rings. The rings are made up of many parts, but we can generally say that the brightest parts form a disk on the plane of Saturn's equator, spanning from $74$ $500\text{ km}$ to $136$ $780\text{ km}$ from the planet's center (rings C, B, and A).

Saturn's north pole points towards $\alpha = 2^h$ $42^m$ $21^s$, $\delta = 83\degree$ $32'$ $13''$ (Saturn-centric Earth equatorial coordinates).

Now that we know some things about Saturn, let's get onto things we need to know to calculate its appearance.\
The sidereal time at $19:00, \text{ January 1, } 2024$ was:
```math
\Theta = 01^h\:43^m\:43.9^s
```
The geocentric locations of Saturn and the Sun were:
- Saturn ($P$):
```math
\begin{align}
\alpha_P &= 22^h\:22^m\:07.21^s\\
\delta_P &= -11\degree\:55'\:54.3''\\
\rho_P &= 1\:540\:141\:300\text{ km}
\end{align}
```
- The Sun ($S$):
```math
\begin{align}
\alpha_S &= 18^h\:45^m\:45.07^s\\
\delta_S &= -23\degree\:01'\:15.8''\\
\rho_S &= 147\:099\:700\text{ km}
\end{align}
```
